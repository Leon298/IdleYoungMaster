# **Game Title:** *Idle Young Master: Regaining Glory*
**Idle Game Design Document**

## **Initial Project Idea**
The player takes on the role of a young master from a prestigious family, living a life of luxury and high society. However, despite appearances, the family is actually drowning in debt and losing more money than they gain. To maintain face, the family has been secretly selling off valuable possessions—paintings, grandfather clocks, rare artifacts—just to keep up the illusion of wealth.

The core gameplay revolves around **managing this deception**, maintaining status in high society, and working toward rebuilding the family's former fortune—eventually exceeding it. The player must carefully balance selling off assets, making smart investments, and regaining lost items to strengthen their influence. 

Selling family items acts as **a temporary resource** but comes with risks—too many sales too quickly will raise suspicion or damage reputation. Conversely, **reacquiring previously sold artifacts** will provide buffs and restore lost status. The prestige/rebirth mechanic involves **upgrading your estate**, starting from a **fading noble villa** to **an opulent, sprawling mansion**.

## **Game Type**
