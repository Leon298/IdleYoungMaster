Idle Game

Initial Project idea

The idea of the game is that youa are "your family is rich" young master who likes to travel around town showing off. you buy rooms of people drinks, show off gifts your family has given you, and just generally boast about anything and everything you can think of.

your goal in life is to become personally rich while not losing face for your family
ie: a common job will kill you socially just as thoroughly as a dagger to the heart



Type:
