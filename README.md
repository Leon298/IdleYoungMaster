# IdleYoungMaster

the following is overworked and needs to be simplified into a few core concepts


**Idle Game Design Document**

# **Game Title:** *Idle Young Master*

## **Initial Project Idea**
The player takes on the role of a young master from a wealthy family, living a life of luxury and social dominance. However, despite their family's immense wealth, they themselves have limited financial resources and must navigate high society without bringing disgrace to their family name.

The core gameplay loop revolves around flaunting wealth, engaging in social interactions, and strategically managing resources to maintain status. The ultimate goal is to become personally rich while avoiding situations that would damage one's reputation. A "common" job is not an option; losing face in high society is equivalent to social death.

## **Game Type**
- **Genre:** Idle/Incremental game
- **Progression:** Milestone-based
- **Core Mechanics:**
  - Passive and active income sources
  - Social reputation management
  - Investment and resource allocation
  - Prestige/rebirth system for long-term progression

## **Core Gameplay Mechanics**
### **1. Home Screen & Visual Progression**
- The game primarily takes place on the home screen, which showcases a **visual representation of your current status**.
- A **small villa** serves as your starting location, provided by your family.
- As you **prestige (rebirth),** your estate expands from a modest home to a **vast and sprawling estate**.
- **Sources of income** are illustrated within the home screen, providing a dynamic display of your financial empire’s growth.

### **2. Resource Management**
- **Wealth** – Money gained through investments, family gifts, and passive income streams.
- **Reputation** – Maintaining an image of success through extravagant displays and social dominance.
- **Favor & Connections** – Gained through social interactions and networking; allows access to exclusive opportunities.

### **3. Social Events & Interactions**
- **Buying Rounds of Drinks** – Gain favor with influential characters, but at a cost.
- **Bragging & Boasting** – Raises reputation but may invite envy and challenges.
- **Hosting Lavish Gatherings** – Large-scale events to gain prestige and social influence.
- **Investing in Elite Ventures** – High-risk, high-reward investments to grow wealth.

### **4. Reputation & Face System**
- **Honor & Prestige** – Measured by how well the player maintains appearances.
- **Challenges from Rivals** – Rivals may attempt to damage your reputation.
- **Patriarch’s Judgment** – The family leader evaluates your status; falling too low results in exile.

## **Intended Challenges**
1. **Your family is rich, not you** – Players must navigate financial constraints while appearing wealthy.
2. **A main character has challenged your 'good' standing** – A powerful social rival threatens your status.
3. **The family patriarch thinks you’re useless** – Failure to meet expectations may result in losing support or resources.

## **Upgrades & Progression**
### **Tier 1 Upgrades**
- **"Your Family is Rich"** – Gain passive income from family gifts.
- **"Not a Stepping Stone"** – Successfully avoid being overshadowed by rivals.
- **"The Family Patriarch Thinks You’re Useless"** – Navigate early challenges to prove yourself.

### **Mid to Late-Game Upgrades** (Examples)

- **"Master of Manipulation"** – Influence people to work in your favor.
- **"The Patriarch’s Favorite"** – Gain access to exclusive investments and support.

## **Prestige/Rebirth System**
- Players can reset their progress in exchange for permanent bonuses, such as:
  - Higher starting wealth
  - Stronger social influence
  - Special abilities or passive effects
  - **Estate upgrades** – Transform your home from a villa into an elite mansion, then into a grand palace.

## **Expansion: Underground Dealings**

- **Dual Reputation System** – Maintain a public persona while secretly growing an empire through unsanctioned dealings.
- **Corrupt Officials & Bribes** – Buy your way out of trouble or into exclusive opportunities.

## **Art & Theme**
- **Aesthetic:** Luxurious high society with elegant characters, lavish parties, and opulent environments.
- **Tone:** Lighthearted satire of aristocracy with humorous undertones.
- **UI Design:** Clean and stylish, resembling a socialite’s ledger or high-society invitation.

## **Potential Expansion Ideas**
